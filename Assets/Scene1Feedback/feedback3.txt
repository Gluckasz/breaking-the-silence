Feedback:
Here, you used logical arguments and examples, but put a little more pressure on the fairness and wrongness of your father's thinking.
The result: your father recognized some facts, but his general view of the world (“life is unfair, you can't change everything”) remained. He heard you, but remained a realistic skeptic.


What worked:
You used strong facts, logical arguments, and real examples to make your point clear to the father.
You showed that you were well-informed

What didn't work:
Emotional detachment: you talked more about the correctness of the system than about the father's experiences.
There was no bridge to his experience - the arguments sounded like a lecture or political discussion, not a family conversation.


What emotions he evoked:
Rational respect ("my arguments are partially disproved")
but also fatigue ("it's all too idealistic, and life is different")


How he interpreted your actions:
"My son/daughter is smart, but does not fully understand reality."
"I'm going to stick to my opinion, because the real world is not that simple."


Why he/she answered this way:
He agreed with some of the facts, but did not feel an emotional connection.
Result: Minimal change in mindset.
