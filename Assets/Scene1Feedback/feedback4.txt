Feedback:
In these cases, your tone was either mocking or too harsh and confrontational.
Even if the arguments were valid, the way you presented them triggered a defensive reaction in your father. He shut down, consolidated his position, and said he was not going to change his mind. Here we can see that it was not the ideas themselves, but the style of communication that influenced the negative outcome.


What worked (minimally):
You stood by your principles and were honest.


What didn't work at all:
Aggressive tone ("you just don't want to understand")
Sarcasm and belittling (even in a humorous way)
Polarization ("I'm right, you're wrong")
instead of engaging in a dialogue, it exacerbated the gap.


What emotions it caused:
Defensiveness ("I'm being attacked")
Feeling of loss of authority ("I'm not respected")
Need to defend old beliefs even more


How he interpreted your actions:
"I am being humiliated. I won't change my mind just because of my pride."


Why he answered this way:
A defensive psychological reaction: instead of changing, he reinforced his old beliefs because of the emotional trauma of the dialogue.
Result: locking in one's position.
