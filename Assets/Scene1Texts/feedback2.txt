Feedback:
Here you still made strong arguments (personal examples, a little humor), but there was a subtle element of direct confrontation.
This did not cause your father's rejection, but it did not give him a complete breakthrough. He partially recognized your arguments, but remained cautious. You changed his perspective partially, but not completely.


What worked:
Personal stories and connections to family (example of grandfather)
A little humor eased the tension
Not losing empathy even in direct confrontation


What didn't work and held back the result a bit:
You hurt your father's ego in some responses (wording like: "You always do that...")
The tone felt a bit instructive or disapproving (even if you were right) it sounded like you were lecturing him.


What emotions did it evoke:
Guilt ("maybe I'm biased")
A defensive reaction ("but I'm not that bad!")


How he interpreted your actions:
"I was partially understood, but also partially accused."
"Maybe I need to think about it, but I'm not ready to openly admit it right away."


Why he answered this way:
He felt pressured to change, but also felt judged, so he chose to be cautious "I'll think about it" with no promises.
