Feedback:
The main factor of success here is recognizing the complexity of the topic and being grateful for the dialog.
You avoided direct accusations, showed respect for your father and his experiences, and recognized that not everything is black and white. This created an atmosphere of cooperation rather than confrontation. As a result, your father opened up to change and thanked you for making him think.


What worked:
Respect for the father (thanking him for the conversation, acknowledging that changing views is difficult)
Shared values (showing that you both value fairness and empathy)
Calm tone + non-pressure argumentation - you didn't force a change of mind, but invited him to think.
No judgment ("you're wrong") - instead: "the situation is complicated", "you need more understanding".


What emotions you evoked:
You evoked your father's pride in you (you understand the complexity of life)
And a sense of security (he is not being judged for his old views)


How he interpreted your actions:
"My child is not attacking me - she is worried."
"I can think and reconsider my views without losing face."


Why he answered that way:
There was a sense of a common goal - not a competition of "who is right," but a search for truth together.
Result: a real movement towards change.
